# SPIT

SPIT is a plugin created with the C++ JUCE Framework. Its design was inspired by a semester of studying modular synthesis systems. This plugin writes random MIDI notes to the piano roll of your DAW. The user can select a number of notes (or a musical scale), a tempo by which new notes are drawn, and a range by which the randomly generated notes will be confined to.
